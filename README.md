# SweetShop
A [demo](https://sweetshop.herokuapp.com/) of PayPal Express Checkout. Developed with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

## Introduction

My first attempt with web development, to implement the [Paypal Express Checkout](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/express-checkout) API that enables a user to make a purchase with Paypal.

## Dependencies

I chose to use the Flask web micro-framework, due to my familiarity with the python language, as well as its simplicity. 

## Learning Points
I have always wanted to learn how to implement a graphic interface for my python scripts, and this was a good opportunity for me to learn about building a web app from the ground up.
